        <h2>Using Technology Safely While Learning</h2>
        <p>
          Technology can greatly support learning, but it‚Äôs important to use it wisely. Protect your personal data by avoiding sharing passwords or private information, 
          especially on unknown sites or apps. Use strong passwords and keep your software updated to avoid security risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take care of your health while learning online by resting your eyes, moving regularly, and sitting comfortably with good lighting. 
          Choose trusted apps and websites recommended by teachers or with good reviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember to keep balance. Technology should help, not replace learning. Safe and mindful use will make your learning more effective and secure.

        <h2>Why language apps are an essential part of my English learning ?</h2>
        <p>
          As a student juggling classes, projects, and daily responsibilities, I know how hard it can be to find time for effective language study. 
          That‚Äôs why I turn to apps. They are my mobile teachers, motivators, and companions on the path to English fluency. 
          I recommend these apps from my own experience because they help me every day and make learning English enjoyable and effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why are apps important? Because they meet the needs of modern learners. They teach at a pace we choose, in places that suit us, and in ways that engage us. 
          They give freedom, motivation, and joy in progress. Most of all, they make learning English a daily adventure, not a chore.

        <p>
          Hi!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the next stage of my final university project, where I‚Äôm researching how technology influences learning English in secondary school.
        </p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to fill out my survey before using any language learning apps. 
          Your opinion matters and will help me better understand how modern tools affect language learning.
        </p>
        </p>
          Thank you so much for your support! üôå

      <h2>The Power of Technology in English Language Learning</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Julia, and I am a third-year student of English Philology with an educational specialization at Vizja University in Warsaw. 
        I plan to pursue a teaching career, which is why I chose this specialization and selected a final project on a topic close to everyone‚Äôs heart‚Äîtechnology. 
        I am very interested in how modern technologies are currently used in schools and what changes students would like to see. Through this project, 
        I aim to enter the teaching profession with greater awareness and better preparation to work in a modern educational environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website was created to support my ongoing project, which aims to analyze the impact of modern technologies on the effectiveness of learning English 
        among high school students. The educational applications presented on the site were selected based on the results of a survey previously conducted among students, 
        allowing the tools to be tailored to their needs and preferences. The website is designed for both students and teachers, offering practical materials to help make 
        better use of technology in everyday English learning.
